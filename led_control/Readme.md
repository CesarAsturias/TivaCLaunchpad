# Controlling the LEDs

In this examples we will see how initialize the Port F to control the LEDs. We will use three different approaches:

- Accessing directly to the required registers.
- Using the ROM drivers.
- Using the GPIO drivers.

## Usage

To compile the code just run make in 'led_control' folder and, if necessary, modify the path to the TivaWare library.

To  program the microcontroller run this from the root folder:
```sh
$ make example_directory flash
```
