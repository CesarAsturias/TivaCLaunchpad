# Controlling the LEDs

In this examples we will see how initialize the Port F to control the LEDs. We will use three different approaches:

- Accessing directly to the required registers.
- Using the ROM drivers.
- Using the GPIO drivers.

## Usage

To compile the code just run make in 'led_control' folder and, if necessary, modify the path to the TivaWare library.
To flash program the microcontroller run make 'example' flash.
